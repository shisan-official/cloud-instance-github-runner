# Fetch the last-boot console output of an ECS instance (forensics before
# destruction). The output carries user-data/cloud-init logs and is
# unrecoverable once the instance is deleted, so callers must invoke this
# BEFORE cleanup-instance.sh.
#
# Contract -- deliberate design decision, do not "fix" (blueprint:
# docs/intent-blueprints/failure-forensics-console-output-v1.blueprint.md):
# forensics is best-effort and billing safety wins. Unlike
# cleanup-instance.sh, which fails loudly because a failed cleanup is a
# leak/billing risk, every failure here (CLI missing / API error / bad JSON /
# bad base64) only emits a stderr warning and exits 0 so the subsequent
# instance destruction is NEVER blocked. A failed fetch costs one log file,
# not money.

# No -e on purpose: with it, any failing forensics command would abort this
# script with a non-zero status and block the cleanup that runs after it.
# Every command failure below is handled explicitly and always ends in
# exit 0.
