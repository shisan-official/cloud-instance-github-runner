"""Structural contract tests for templates/user-data.sh.

Anchors from fix-instance-leak-three-defenses (AC-1/AC-1b/AC-2) plus the
watchdog-hardening-v1 contract (wh AC-1..AC-6, wh AC-9). The retired AC-3
post-job-hook pin was replaced by test_post_job_hook_dead_config_removed
(wh AC-5/AC-6): ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_POST_JOB was never read by actions/runner,
so the hook was dead config from day one, not a defense line.

user-data.sh runs inside cloud-init on the ECS instance and cannot be exercised
behaviorally in this credential-free repo (see the blueprint's note on the
honest coverage limit of structural ACs). These tests encode the blueprint's
chapter-ordering anchors as plain-text line-order assertions.
