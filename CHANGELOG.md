## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Masked the runner registration token with core.setSecret. A token minted at run time is not one of the workflow's configured secrets, so it was printed in clear text by every later step that carried it through env:

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Hardened runner-watchdog: three-state probe (active / confirmed-inactive / query-failure-unknown) separates transient query failures from confirmed service stops; self-destruct now requires N consecutive confirmed-inactive probes (STOP_CONFIRMATIONS_REQUIRED, default 6 = 30s) instead of a single miss
- Added pre-destroy forensics dump (probe timeline + systemctl/journal tails, size-capped, to watchdog log + serial console)
- Added bootstrap-time validation of STOP_CONFIRMATIONS_REQUIRED from /etc/environment (loud failure via EXIT trap)

### Changed

### Removed

- Removed inert post-job hook dead config (ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_POST_JOB never read by the runner; official variable is ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED — teardown is handled by the hardened watchdog)

### Fixed

- Fixed stale wait-for-runner.sh timeout comment ("5 minutes" -> 120 seconds)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added `spot_strategy` action input: explicit bidding strategy selection — `SpotAsPriceGo` (follow market price automatically; the multiplier and computed price limit do not affect bidding, no `--SpotPriceLimit` is sent; inputs are still fully validated) takes priority over `spot_price_multiplier`; default `SpotWithPriceLimit` preserves existing behavior. Explicit `SpotWithPriceLimit` with no limit available now fails loudly instead of silently switching.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added `spot_price_multiplier` action input: multiplier applied to the spot market price to compute `SpotPriceLimit` (default `1.2`, preserving existing bid behavior)
- Added `spot_duration` action input: spot protection period in hours, only `0` or `1` (default `1`; spot instances are billed by second regardless of this setting). Although the documented API default is also `1`, users observed frequent sub-hour price-based reclamation before this change — the explicit `--SpotDuration 1` now enforces the 1-hour protection instead of relying on the implicit default

### Changed

- Formatted `SpotPriceLimit` values to three decimal places in all code paths, aligning with the Aliyun RunInstances API constraint (at most 3 decimal places)
- Passed `--SpotDuration` explicitly to RunInstances (default `1`; the documented API default is treated as unreliable in practice — see the `spot_duration` note above)

### Removed

- Removed unused dead code `calculate_spot_price_limit()` from `scripts/create_spot_instance.py`

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- Added branding configuration (icon and color) to action.yml for GitHub Marketplace support
- Added CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Added CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated validation of action.yml
- Added release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) for automated release creation
- Added `scripts/update-changelog.sh` script for automating CHANGELOG.md version updates

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-13

### Changed

- Updated README to clarify PAT (Personal Access Token) access and permissions requirements
